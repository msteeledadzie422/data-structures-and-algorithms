Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Create a Binary Tree class with pre order, in order, and post order traversal methods.

Create a Binary Search Tree subclass within the Binary Tree Class that has an add and a contains method.

## Solution
Code can be successfully run using the command 'python3 -m code_challenges/trees/binary_tree' or 'python3 -m code_challenges/trees/binary_search_tree'.
Code can be successfully tested using the command 'pytest code_challenges/trees'.
