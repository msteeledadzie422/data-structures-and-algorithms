# Linked List Implementation

Implementation of a new Linked List

## Whiteboard Process
N/A

## Approach & Efficiency
This Linked List Class has the ability to instantiate a Linked List, insert Nodes into a Linked List, verify whether a value exists within the Linked List as a Node, and can return a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

The space/time complexity of this will be O(n) because the Linked List will grow with the size of the data input.

## Solution
Code can be successfully run using the command python3 -m linked_list.linked_list, and tested using the command pytest tests/data_structures/test_linked_list.py
